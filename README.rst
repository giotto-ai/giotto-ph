``giotto-ph`` is a high-performance implementation of Vietorisâ€“Rips (VR) persistence, and is distributed under the GNU AGPLv3 license.
It consists of an improved reimplementation of `Morozov and Nigmetov's "lock-free Ripser" <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3350755.3400244>`_,
integrated with an improved reimplementation of `GUDHI's Edge Collapse (EC) algorithm <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02395227>`_ and with support
for weighted VR filtrations. See also https://github.com/Ripser/ripser/pull/31, https://github.com/grey-narn/oineus (lock-free Ripser), and http://gudhi.gforge.inria.fr/doc/latest/group__edge__collapse.html (GUDHI's EC implementation).

``giotto-ph`` is part of the `Giotto <https://github.com/giotto-ai>`_ family of open-source projects and designed for tight integration with
the `giotto-tda <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda>`_ and `pyflagser <https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda>`_ libraries.
